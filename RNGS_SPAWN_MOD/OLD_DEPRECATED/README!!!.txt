MY BIGGEST UPDATE SO FAR!

V5 - EXPERIMENTAL (new wave spawner system by me :D)

this file has been built from the ground up, you will notice the raids will feel different compared to my other files, (bots are allowed to convert to opposite faction again FINALLY!)
there are still some small kinks for me to work out, 

such as the raids may take about 5ish minutes to populate all factions, compared to 60s, (this exists due to not flooding bot pools with the same faction filling raid with all scav/all pmc)      (i will do this to factory soon hehe secret msg)
(ur gonna feel the difference)    

i  highly reccomend the "as online" AI amount preset, high seems to work too, but it floods the bot pool quicker so can cause less chance of variety, try them all if ur brave!

before doing any more fine tuning to THIS file, i feel i will need to port 

this file has some dependencys and cant be edited like usual location base without causing issues, 

there are some things you can and id reccomend to play around with

  "BotMax" 
  "BotMaxPlayer" - be careful you can break spawn ratios

you can increase these, keep in mind it wont generate more "waves" 

"Rules" 

                    (Normal: = default scavs will fight pmc, pmc wont fight same faction )
                    (AvoidOwnPMC: ?? test this i didnt have time)
                    (AvoidAllPMC: ALL PMC HOSTILE TO SAME FACTION/OPPOSITE FACTION & SCAVS)



i really hope you guys enjoy this file, and the fps heheh,
if this recives good feedback and is preffered to my other files, i will start rebuilding other maps from the ground up to make them feel much more live like/less jank for ratios,

boring stuff:

fixed raids were usually all usec or all scav because bot pool flooded, (we need to trickle bots in slowly not flood the pool to max so they have time to convert)
added ability to spawn bots anywhere not just in a specific zone 
versioned master zip
fixed broken botgenerate console spam thats existed since 3.8 
fixed crazy wave amounts getting out of hand to 100 bots 10 minutes in, expect raids to finish around 60-70
restructured mod to be more user friendly, 

AND FINALLY, PLEASE GIVE ME FEEDBACK ON THIS FILE COMPARED TO BOTH VANILLA AND MY PREVIOUS FILES, FOR LIVE LIKENESS PERFOMANCE RATIOS ETC... is it finally perfect?  i appreciate you guys through this learning process with me.

thankyou for reading as always <3 RNG
