Thankyou for downloading! 

IF YOUVE ALREADY READ THIS SEE THE README IN rezervebase>base (REZ FIX V5 STABLE)
	
Files are located in RNGSPAWN.MASTER>RNGS_SPAWN_MOD>THE MAP YOU WANT> 

TO REPLACE A MAP MOVE MY FILE INTO SIT_DIR>SERVER>AKIDATA>SERVER>DATABASE>LOCATIONS>THE MAP YOU WANT TO CHANGE

name ur old base files "base.bak" to keep a backup 

it is desired when adding changes to location.DB to delete the cache Found in 
SIT_DIR>SERVER>USER>CACHE>DELETE BOTH JSONS. NOT SITCOOP!

V1 files = Untested, there may be issues still need fixing like no pmc etc... report any issues!

IF A FOLDER IN MY MOD IS EMPTY, THIS MEANS I HAVENT FINISHED THE MAP YET!!! PLEASE STAY PATIENT!

V5 - EXPERIMENTAL (3.8) (new wave spawner system by me :D)

this file has been built from the ground up, you will notice the raids will feel different compared to my other files, (bots are allowed to convert to opposite faction again FINALLY!)
there are still some small kinks for me to work out, 

such as the raids may take about 5ish minutes to populate all factions, compared to 60s, (this exists due to not flooding bot pools with the same faction filling raid with all scav/all pmc) 
(ur gonna feel the difference)    

this file has some dependencys and cant be edited like usual location base without causing issues, 

there are some things you can and id reccomend to play around with

  "BotMax" 
  "BotMaxPlayer" - be careful you can break spawn ratios

you can increase these, keep in mind it wont generate more "waves" 

(3.7.3)
